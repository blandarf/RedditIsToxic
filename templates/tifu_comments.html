      <td>You are an unluckier version of me, i also went on a school trip to Canberra, Aus 10yrs ago. We too as a class, in our school uniforms visited the national gallery of australia. \n\nWhile walking around I was so mesmerized by a large painting that i started walking backwards with my sight on the painting, totally unaware of which direction i was backing towards when my heel hit a platform and i fell on my ass .. on the ground.\n\nIt was a sculpture piece displayed on a mounted platform with no barricade around. \n\nThe fall felt 10 hours long, i can feel my heart pounding, i started looking frantically around i can see all the faces lit up with horror staring at me. \n\nBut later during that trip we came back to the gallery a 2nd time and while i was walking around with my friends  more carefully this time, my friend walked right up to a painting and pointed at it Rreaall close that the guard had to yell across the room SSTTTOOOOOPP!! From that point on whenever we entered a new section a diffrent guard would watch us closely and made it super obvious to glare at us\n\nIt was a fun trip</td>

      <td>I don‚Äôt wanna be a killjoy or like dox myself but i work in the field of paintings movements and have had hands-on experience with this work. you didn‚Äôt ruin it so don‚Äôt feel bad, and it isn‚Äôt roped off into another room. that‚Äôs called a temporary exhibitions changeover. the painting is being conserved as an earlyish example of large scale acrylic / mixed media painting to see how to paint behaves as it ages and also to clean the surface of dirt. also the gallery doesn‚Äôt ban schools bc they‚Äôre an optional part of the national excursion curriculum. but this happened when u were in year 9 so i don‚Äôt expect you to remember or know all that!</td>

      <td>Years ago I was at a certain world famous European art museum with my mother and she was admiring a painting and says ‚Äúlook at this amazing color‚Äù and without thinking just reached out and touched a 300+ year old painting. I was horrified and looked all around but there was no security in sight and apparently no one watching on camera. This was about 25 years ago, and maybe security is heavier now, but it was nothing like what you see in major American museums.</td>
